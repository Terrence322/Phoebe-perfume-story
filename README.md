# Image Quiz Demo

This project is a small interactive page with three questions. Each question displays an image from this repository. The first image contains clickable hotspots (lotus, log and shore stones) that glow when hovered or clicked. User choices are recorded in JavaScript and shown at the end.

Open `index.html` in your browser to try it out.

## GitHub Pages Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the site to
GitHub Pages. Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, the workflow in
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` uploads the contents of the repository and
publishes them as a static site.
