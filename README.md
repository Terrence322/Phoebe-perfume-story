# Image Quiz Demo

This project is a small interactive page with three questions. Each question displays an image from this repository. The first image contains clickable hotspots (lotus, log and shore stones) that glow when hovered or clicked. User choices are recorded in JavaScript and shown at the end.

Open `index.html` in your browser to try it out.
