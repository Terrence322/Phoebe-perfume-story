# Phoebe Perfume Story

This simple web app lets users create a personalized perfume formula through a short interactive story. Answer four multiple-choice questions and give your perfume a name to see the ingredient proportions. The final formula assumes a total of **4.5 g** of fragrance ingredients.

Only a curated set of materials is used in the recipe. Top, middle and base notes are randomly chosen from the following lists:

- 前調：含羞草、無花果、白葡萄酒、伯爵茶茶、香檸檬、桂花
- 中調：小蒼蘭、天竺葵、橙花、青草、金銀花、茉莉花、海洋
- 後調：禪茶、零陵香豆、白麝香、麝香、檀香木、紅木、香草
